                <p>Miguel was found in a state of severe malnutrition and was enrolled without a sponsor so that his life could be saved. His challenges are numerous as his mother died two years ago and, during his hospital stay for nutritional rehabilitation, he was found to be HIV positive. His father and siblings were subsequently tested and his father was also found to be HIV positive.</p>
                <p>OWH social workers are providing weekly transportation to Guatemala City where the two are receiving antiretroviral medications which will prolong their lives. <strong>After only one and a half months in the OWH sponsorship program, Miguel started to gain weight and walk on his own.</strong> His siblings are also receiving food, vitamins, and medical care from the ministry and will be cared for in the event that the father is no longer able to care for them.</p>

            <p>The reach of Outreach for World Hope extends far beyond individual families. When we arrive in a village, something remarkable happens: people walk for miles‚Äîsometimes hours‚Äîfrom surrounding communities to participate in our programs.</p>
            <img src="img/OWH-Village.jpeg" alt="Village gathering for Outreach for World Hope programs" class="program-image">
            <p>These gatherings are a testament to the desperate need and the transformative power of hope. Families who have no other access to medical care, clean water, or nutritional support make extraordinary efforts to reach our mobile clinics and distribution centers.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">The impact ripples outward: one water filter protects an entire household, one stove changes a family's health trajectory, one sponsored child brings hope to an entire community.</p>
            <p>This is why your support matters so profoundly‚Äîbecause every gift you give multiplies as it spreads from family to family, village to village.</p>
